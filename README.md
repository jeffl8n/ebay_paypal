You will need Node.js and some basic modules.  Run `npm install & bower install` to verify you have all of the dependencies.  

[I am using EJS for templating](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)

Run `grunt` to start the local server with live reload capabilities.

I have tried to seperate front end views from data by creating an api seperate from the HTML/Angular

Example:

view and add questions at /questions

view json of questions at /api/questions
