You will need Node.js and some basic modules
[I believe you can just 'npm install'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8367031/how-do-i-install-package-json-dependencies-in-the-current-directory-using-npm)

[I am using EJS for templating](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)

Run the app.js from cmd line with `node app` 

I have tried to seperate front end views from data by creating an api seperate from the HTML/Angular

Example:

view and add questions at /questions

view json of questions at /api/questions
